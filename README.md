**Build a Palindrome Checker**

A <dfn>palindrome</dfn> is a word or phrase that can be read the same way forwards and backwards, ignoring punctuation, case, and spacing.

**Note:** You'll need to remove **all non-alphanumeric characters** (punctuation, spaces and symbols) and turn everything into the same case (lower or upper case) in order to check for palindromes.

**Objective:** Build an app that is functionally similar to <a href="https://palindrome-checker.freecodecamp.rocks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">https://palindrome-checker.freecodecamp.rocks</a>.

**User Stories:**

1. You should have an `input` element with an `id` of `"text-input"`.
1. You should have a `button` element with an `id` of `"check-btn"`.
1. You should have a `div`, `span` or `p` element with an `id` of `"result"`.
1. When you click on the `#check-btn` element without entering a value into the `#text-input` element, an alert should appear with the text `"Please input a value"`.
1. When the `#text-input` element only contains the letter `A` and the `#check-btn` element is clicked, the `#result` element should contain the text `"A is a palindrome"`.
1. When the `#text-input` element contains the text `eye` and the `#check-btn` element is clicked, the `#result` element should contain the text `"eye is a palindrome"`.
1. When the `#text-input` element contains the text `_eye` and the `#check-btn` element is clicked, the `#result` element should contain the text `"_eye is a palindrome"`.
1. When the `#text-input` element contains the text `race car` and the `#check-btn` element is clicked, the `#result` element should contain the text `"race car is a palindrome"`.
1. When the `#text-input` element contains the text `not a palindrome` and the `#check-btn` element is clicked, the `#result` element should contain the text `"not a palindrome is not a palindrome"`.
1. When the `#text-input` element contains the text `A man, a plan, a canal. Panama` and the `#check-btn` element is clicked, the `#result` element should contain the text `"A man, a plan, a canal. Panama is a palindrome"`.
1. When the `#text-input` element contains the text `never odd or even` and the `#check-btn` element is clicked, the `#result` element should contain the text `"never odd or even is a palindrome"`.
1. When the `#text-input` element contains the text `nope` and the `#check-btn` element is clicked, the `#result` element should contain the text `"nope is not a palindrome"`.
1. When the `#text-input` element contains the text `almostomla` and the `#check-btn` element is clicked, the `#result` element should contain the text `"almostomla is not a palindrome"`.
1. When the `#text-input` element contains the text `My age is 0, 0 si ega ym.` and the `#check-btn` element is clicked, the `#result` element should contain the text `"My age is 0, 0 si ega ym. is a palindrome"`.
1. When the `#text-input` element contains the text `1 eye for of 1 eye.` and the `#check-btn` element is clicked, the `#result` element should contain the text `"1 eye for of 1 eye. is not a palindrome"`.
1. When the `#text-input` element contains the text `0_0 (: /-\ :) 0-0` and the `#check-btn` element is clicked, the `#result` element should contain the text `"0_0 (: /-\ :) 0-0 is a palindrome"`.
1. When the `#text-input` element contains the text `five|\_/|four` and the `#check-btn` element is clicked, the `#result` element should contain the text `"five|\_/|four is not a palindrome"`.
